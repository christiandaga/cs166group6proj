Using XGBoost to build a classification model for finding the botness twitter users

## Running

```python predict.py {TWITTER_ID}```

The twitter id can be found by using this tool: [Find Twitter ID](https://codeofaninja.com/tools/find-twitter-id/)

## Training

trained_model.json is the currently trained model.

Modifying train_model.py and running it will output a new model to be used by predict.py
